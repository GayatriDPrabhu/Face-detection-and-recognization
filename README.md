# Face-detection-and-recognization

•	This project which was built using OpenCV aimed at blurring a particular face amongst the other faces.


•	To detect the faces Cascade Classifier was used and to recognize a particular face Fisher Face algorithm was used. This algorithm was trained with data containing the face to blurred labeled as 1 and other random faces labeled as zero.
